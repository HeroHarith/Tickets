Detailed Breakdown
1. API Layer
Routes:
In src/api/routes/, you define your RESTful endpoints or GraphQL resolvers. Grouping them by feature (e.g., tickets, users, authentication) keeps the routing logic clear.

Controllers:
Controllers (in src/api/controllers/) handle incoming HTTP requests, invoke necessary services, and return responses. By keeping controllers focused solely on HTTP logic, you decouple request handling from business logic.

Middlewares:
Middleware functions (in src/api/middlewares/) can handle common tasks such as verifying JWT tokens (authentication), validating request bodies, or formatting error responses. Centralizing these functions improves code reuse and clarity.

2. Configuration
Config Files:
Store database connections, third-party API configurations, and other environment-dependent settings in the src/config/ folder. This organization allows you to quickly adjust settings without touching your business logic.

3. Data Models
Models:
In src/models/, define your data models. For example, if you’re using MongoDB with Mongoose, this is where you’d define the schemas for tickets, users, and any other entities. Alternatively, if you’re using SQL with an ORM (like Sequelize), your model definitions reside here.

4. Services
Business Logic:
Services (in src/services/) contain the core business logic and interact with your models. They abstract data access from the controllers. For instance, ticketService.js might handle ticket creation, updates, and retrieval—centralizing business rules and validations.

5. Utilities
Helper Functions:
Functions that are used across different parts of the application, such as logging, error formatting, or string manipulation functions, can reside in src/utils/.

6. Application Bootstrapping
App Initialization:
The src/app.js file sets up the Express application by importing and using routes, middlewares, and configuring plugins.

Server Entry Point:
The src/server.js file is responsible for creating the HTTP server, connecting to the database, and listening for incoming requests.
